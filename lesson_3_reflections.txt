When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work locally?
When you want to collaborate with others or when you need to save work in the cloud.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with you remote repository?
Manual pulls give you more control.  There might be a lot of changes before Git automatically updates the repository.
